Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident
Issue Summary:
Duration: The outage occurred on January 25, 2024, from 14:00 to 17:30 UTC.
Impact: The outage affected the availability of our web application, leading to a 30% reduction in user access. Users experienced slow page loads and intermittent errors during the incident.
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing uneven distribution of traffic to backend servers.
Timeline:
- 14:00 UTC: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in error rates and latency.
- 14:05 UTC: Engineering team notified automatically through our incident response system.
- 14:15 UTC: Initial investigation focused on backend services, assuming a potential issue with database connectivity.
- 14:30 UTC: No anomalies found in the backend, suspicion shifted towards the load balancer.
- 15:00 UTC: Misleading assumption that the load balancer was overwhelmed due to sudden increased traffic.
- 15:30 UTC: Issue escalated to the infrastructure team for a detailed examination of load balancer configurations.
- 16:00 UTC: Root cause identified - misconfiguration in load balancer algorithm leading to uneven traffic distribution.
- 16:30 UTC: Load balancer settings corrected, but an additional issue discovered with a misbehaving application server.
- 17:00 UTC: Incident escalated to application development team for further investigation.
- 17:30 UTC: Issue resolved by reconfiguring the load balancer and fixing the misbehaving application server.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The misconfiguration in the load balancer algorithm caused unequal distribution of traffic, overloading certain backend servers while leaving others underutilized.
Resolution: Load balancer settings were corrected to ensure even distribution of traffic among backend servers. Additionally, the misbehaving application server was identified and isolated, preventing further degradation.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To Improve/Fix:
1. Enhance Monitoring: Implement more granular monitoring to quickly detect load balancer and server misconfigurations.
   
2. Documentation Update: Ensure comprehensive documentation of load balancer settings to avoid future misconfigurations.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
1. Load Balancer Audit: Conduct a thorough audit of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations. 
2. Automated Testing: Implement automated testing for load balancer configurations to catch misconfigurations during the deployment phase.
3. Capacity Planning: Regularly review and update capacity planning to accommodate sudden spikes in traffic without overloading specific servers.
4. Incident Response Training: Provide incident response training to the engineering team to streamline detection and resolution processes.
Conclusion:
The web stack outage was a result of a misconfiguration in the load balancer, causing uneven traffic distribution and impacting user experience. Through a systematic investigation, the root cause was identified and promptly addressed. Moving forward, the implementation of enhanced monitoring, automated testing, and continuous capacity planning will fortify our infrastructure against similar incidents, ensuring a more robust and reliable web application for our users.
